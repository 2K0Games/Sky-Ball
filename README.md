# Sky-Ball
Based on the Roll-A-Ball Project on Unity's Tutorials and augmented into the game it is right now.
In this game, you are in the sky and you have to move the ball around on the ground plus the ramps, 
and collect squares while not crashing on the orange towers or lava, in order to complete the level.
Once you complete all the levels you complete the game and play again as much as you want.
After you finish level 3 you can skip to level 4 if you lose. Thank you for checking out my game, and tell me how it went.
