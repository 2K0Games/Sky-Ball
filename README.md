# Sky-Ball
Based on the Roll-A-Ball Project on Unity's Tutorials and augmented into the game it is now.
In this game, you are in the sky and have to move the ball around on the ground plus the ramps and collect squares while not crashing on the orange towers or lava to complete the level.
Once you complete all the levels, you complete the game and play again as much as you want.
After you finish level 3, you can skip to level 4 if you lose.
